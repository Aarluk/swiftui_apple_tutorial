Apple Developer Tutorials for SwiftUI

I just completed the #SwiftUI tutorials from the Apple Developer documentation. If like me, you are passionate about creating clean, modern and pixel perfect #visualexperiences while leveraging your knowledge of declarative frameworks like React.js, you will have a blast! So far, what I have enjoyed the most is how Xcode updates the user interface instantly, showing live, tangible results of what you're coding (thanks to the Xcode Live Previews feature). Another advantage of SwiftUI is the speed with which it allows Engineers to develop a User Interface since SwiftUI has a declarative nature.

The tutorials are step-by-step clear instructions followed with questions to check your understanding on the main concepts. This was so much fun and I am now tackling the 100-day Swift challenge by Paul Hudson, recommended by talented and passionate iOS Developer Shubham Singh. I highly recommend following Shubham's Instagram account where he shares excellent iOS development content, tips and animated videos of his creations (https://lnkd.in/dsANv7J).
